Rally Team Tactics is a race strategy videogame [available on itch.io](https://barracudaia.itch.io/rttgoldmaster) designed for students aged 8 to 12 within the European curriculum, aligning with the NextGenerationEU plan.

As the copilot in a rally race, players make strategic decisions that are analyzed through metrics (time or fuel) to assess their development of critical cognitive skills like algorithmic thinking, generalization, and abstraction.

Developed by a new team, Rally Team Tactics was well-received by players and educators alike, achieving an outstanding academic qualification because of its innovation. While the tight release schedule limited refactoring opportunities, the project served as a valuable learning experience for the team.
