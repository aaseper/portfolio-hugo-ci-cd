### Driven backend developer with a passion for problem-solving

I'm a highly motivated Computer Engineering and Videogame Development graduate from King Juan Carlos University (URJC). My passion for software development fuels my drive to learn and tackle new challenges. I possess a strong foundation in designing and developing IT systems and architectures, alongside a keen interest in expanding my skillset in Backend, Sysadmin, Data Science, Machine Learning, Cloud DevOps, and Cybersecurity.

### Proven track record of innovation and collaboration

During my internship, I leveraged my data science fluency to build a B2B platform that optimizes investment strategies for a leading bank. This project exemplifies my ability to apply technical skills to real-world problems and deliver impactful solutions.

### Building user-centric solutions with accessibility in mind

My commitment extends beyond technical excellence. I spearheaded the development of an accessible mobile password manager based on Bitwarden, specifically designed to empower people with disabilities. This project reflects my dedication to creating user-friendly solutions that cater to diverse needs.

### Leadership and initiative: bringing people together

While actively involved in student organizations, I thrived in leadership roles. As president of the General Association of Students and Representatives (ANGER), I spearheaded multidisciplinary events exceeding 150 participants, fostering collaboration across faculties. My experience as a Government Councilor, Center Delegate, and national representative at URJC honed my communication and teamwork skills.

### Continuous learning and a passion for sharing knowledge

My thirst for knowledge doesn't stop at academics. I actively pursue personal projects, ranging from RESTful microservices to multiplayer videogames, to push my boundaries. Additionally, I volunteered at HURJC hospital and mentored at the AULA education fair, demonstrating my commitment to giving back to the community.
